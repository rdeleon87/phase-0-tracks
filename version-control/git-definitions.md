# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Verison control is the keeping track of any changes made to the code by assigning a verison name or number eveytime it is updated with new code. It is importnant because you can see when where and who made a change that possible could have caused a bug or the code to not work.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
a branch is a part of a repository  where you can do work inside of and not affect the rest of the repository untikl you choose to merge it with the master branch
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
a commit is when you save something to the repository locally. a good commit message would state exactly what was changed or saved ie "added version.txt file"
* What is a merge conflict?
a merge conlfict is when git cannot figure out which verison is correct. ie somebody deletes a file in one version and somebody else modifies the file.
